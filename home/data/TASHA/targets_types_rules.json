/** Rules for mapping targets to data types
 *  Each target stores an array of numbers and 0's 
 *  marking the requirement of a data type
 *  or aggregator in the corresponding task
 *  NOTE: a 0 value means a type is optional
 *  it may still exist but it is not required
 *  The order of types in the arrays is: 
 *  			 [q, t, n, o, agg]
